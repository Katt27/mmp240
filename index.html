    <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
    <p> Hello! I have so many nicknames but two that sticks are Kathy or Cheeky (my chubby cheeks). <br>
    I am a native New Yorker. My first home was Williamsburg, Brooklyn (southside) and I have been <br>
    a resident of the Lower Manhattan within the last 20 years of my life. My family from both sides <br>
    are from Arecibo, Puerto Rico and migrated to the US in the late 1950s. I was a full-time BMCC <br>
    student when I graduated high school in 2004 and I returned to finish my education during the <br>
    pandemic especially losing a number of loved ones to the virus. My father lost his fight to covid <br>
    two days before my 34th birthday and he always said he wanted to leave this Earth knowing my sister <br>
    and I are stable and okay. In order to honor that and his love for education, I came back to BMCC <br>
    to obtain my Associates in Science with the hopes of transfering to NYU and obtaining a Bachelor's <br>
    in Fine Arts. <br>
